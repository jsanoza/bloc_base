/// Disposable dependencies are dependencies that can only live in a certain
/// widget's lifespan.
///
/// For example: If we're going to provide a store which we know it will only
/// live while the [UserAccount] is authenticated, we must provide it
/// immediately higher tree level of the tabbed navigator. This way, when we
/// logout, the provided stores which in some cases needed disposal will
/// be disposed as the mentioned screen is intended to be disposed as well.
/// Check [AuthenticatedDependencyProvider]
///
/// Here we can provide providers that can be use by user who are not yet authenticated inside the app
